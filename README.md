# Pizza N More

A project developed entirely by me as part of my first semester (first year) in Master of Computer Applications (MCA).

It is a simple fast food ordering system implemented using PHP as front end and MySQL for back end storage.

It was built as an inital attempt to learn PHP programming.

It uses advanced web technologies viz. HTML, CSS, Javascript.
